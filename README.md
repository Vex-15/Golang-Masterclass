# Golang Masterclass

This is where I actually learn Go — not by taking notes I'll never open again, but by building things, breaking them, and fixing them until they make sense.

I build projects as I learn, extending many of them beyond the original idea to explore how Go works in practice. Whenever a concept clicks, I try to push it a little further, turn it into something practical, and write about the projects that teach me the most.
This repository is the running record of that — my public learning journal.

If you're learning Go too, I hope something in here saves you an hour of confusion I had to sit through myself.

## How This Is Organized

Each top-level folder is a concept area. Inside, you'll usually find a small standalone Go program exploring one idea, and sometimes a full project where a few ideas come together.

```text
Golang-Masterclass
│
├── goroutines/                     # Concurrency: the core of this repo so far
│   ├── main.go                     # Ping-pong with context cancellation
│   ├── Mutex/                      # Thread-safe bank account with sync.Mutex
│   └── Project - FileDownloader/   # Concurrent file downloader (featured project)
│
├── Practise/                       # Early warm-up snippets, kept as a record of day one
│
└── README.md
```

The repository grows naturally as I explore new concepts and build more projects.

## What's Inside So Far

### Concurrency

Concepts explored:

- Goroutines
- WaitGroups
- Channels
- Mutexes
- Context Cancellation
- Buffered Channels

Projects:

- Ping-Pong with Context Cancellation
- Mutex-Protected Bank Account
- Concurrent File Downloader


### Early Practice (`Practise/`)

Some of my very first Go snippets from before I had any real footing in the language. I'm keeping these instead of deleting them because they're an honest starting point — it's easier to see how far something has come when the beginning is still there.

More folders will show up as I move further into the course and start branching into things like networking and backend basics.

## Featured Project: Concurrent File Downloader

The project I'm proudest of so far. It downloads multiple files at once instead of one-by-one, and along the way covers:

- Goroutines and WaitGroups for running downloads in parallel
- A buffered-channel semaphore to cap how many downloads run concurrently
- Channels for collecting results (size, duration, errors) from each worker
- A basic sequential-vs-concurrent comparison to see the actual speedup

I wrote a full walkthrough of how it's built, including a code review section where I go back and point out real bugs in my own implementation rather than pretending the first version was clean:

📖 **[Building a Concurrent File Downloader in Go: A Practical Guide to Goroutines](https://medium.com/@vexstack/building-a-concurrent-file-downloader-in-go-a-practical-guide-to-goroutines-4071dd01f946)**

## Running a Project

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vex-15/Golang-Masterclass.git
cd Golang-Masterclass
```

Each folder is self-contained, so just `cd` into whichever one you want and run it:

```bash
cd goroutines
go run .
```

For nested projects (like the file downloader), go one level deeper:

```bash
cd "goroutines/Project - FileDownloader"
go run .
```

## Why I'm Doing This in the Open

I could keep this all local and never show anyone the messy parts. But building in public keeps me honest about what I actually understand versus what I've just copied from a tutorial, and it means the mistakes are as visible as the wins — which is usually the more useful part for anyone else learning the same thing.

If you spot something I got wrong, or a cleaner way to do what I did, I'd genuinely like to hear it. Open an issue or a PR.
